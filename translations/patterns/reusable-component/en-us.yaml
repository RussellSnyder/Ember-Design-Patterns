    title: Resuable Component Pattern
    pattern-explanation:
      show: But Why? 
      hide: Ok, that's enough man....
      overview: passes initial data as individual, configurable properties and exposes an action to be handled in the calling context
      use-cases:
        u1: Building an Addon for the Ember Community :-)
        u2: Components that will be reused in various scenarios in different routes and with different models
      rabbit-holes:
        r1: A component will only be used with one model and should modify the data directly
        r2: A component should not be 'context aware' (know what the route has for state)
        r3: If the above is true, see the single purpose component pattern
