<h2>Reusable Components</h2>
{{#amount-incrementor 
  amount=50 
  onAmountIncrement=(action send "routeAction")
}}{{/amount-incrementor}}

<PatternExplanation @showText="But why?">
  Pure data down, actions up<br>
  passes initial data as individual, configurable properties<br>
  exposes an action to be handled in the calling context<br>

    <h3>Pattern is great for</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Building an Addon for the Ember Community :-)
      </li>    
      <li>
        Components that will be reused in various scenarios in different routes and with different models
      </li>    
    </ul>
    <h3>Pattern is probably overkill when</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A component will only be used with one model and should modify the data directly
      </li>    
      <li>
        A component should not be 'context aware' (know what the route has for state)
      </li>    
      <li>
        If the above is true, see the {{#link-to 'patterns.component.single-purpose'}}single purpose{{/link-to}} component pattern
      </li>    
    </ul>
