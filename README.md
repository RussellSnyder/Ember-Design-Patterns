## Pattern 1 - User Pods

better encapsulation of concerns
used with any other js framework
classic is kept for largely legacy reasons

we'll use pods for everything from now on.
see see https://cli.emberjs.com/release/advanced-use/project-layouts/

```
// .ember-cli
  "usePods": true
```

```
// config/environment.js
let ENV = {
    modulePrefix: 'my-new-app',
    // namespaced directory where resolver will look for your resource files
    podModulePrefix: 'my-new-app/pods',
    environment: environment,
    rootURL: '/',
    locationType: 'auto'
    //...
  };
```
